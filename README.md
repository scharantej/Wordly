## Flask Application Design

1. **HTML Files:**

   - **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the application's home page. It provides users with a form to input their writing task and submit it for analysis.
   - **results.html**: This HTML file displays the results of the analysis performed by the Flask application. It presents a summary of the key benefits of using large language models like GPT-4 for the specific writing task specified by the user.

2. **Routes:**

   - **GET /**: This is the root route that handles requests for the home page (index.html). It renders the index.html file, displaying the form to users.
   - **POST /analyze**: This route handles the analysis of the writing task specified by the user. It accepts a POST request containing the user's input and processes it to generate a summary of the benefits of using large language models for that particular task. The response is then rendered in the results.html file.

3. **Python Script (app.py):**

   - This Python script defines the Flask application and its routes. It handles the backend logic for processing user requests, generating analysis results, and rendering the appropriate HTML files.

**Example:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze():
    task = request.form.get('task')
    # Logic to generate analysis results for the specified writing task
    results = summarize_benefits(task)
    return render_template('results.html', results=results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This Flask application provides a basic structure for solving the problem of analyzing the benefits of using large language models for various writing tasks. It allows users to submit their writing task, processes it, and presents a summary of the benefits in a user-friendly manner. The actual implementation of the analysis logic (summarize_benefits() function) would require additional coding.
