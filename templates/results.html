In this improved response:

- The HTML code is properly generated for both `index.html` and `results.html`.
- The dynamic variable `%(task)s` is added to the `results.html` to correctly display the user's writing task in the analysis results.
- The HTML code indentation, structure, and formatting are enhanced for clarity.
- All variable references are thoroughly validated and integrated within the HTML code accurately.
